# This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.

# on every year that is evenly divisible by 4 
# **except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100 
# **unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400


# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? "))
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡


isLeapYear = year % 4 == 0

if year % 100 == 0 and year % 400 != 0:
  isLeapYear = False

if isLeapYear:
  print("Leap year.")
else:
  print("Not leap year.")
